            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div class="one">
                <h5>OVERVIEW</h5>
                <p>I worked with The Washington Post’s convert team on our subscription acquisition touchpoints. Subscriptions make up the majority of our revenue, but our numbers have been in decline (8.32% Y/Y in 2022), reaching a low of approximately 2.5 million subscriptions. Overall traffic to The Washington Post has also declined by 22%% Y/Y in 2022. A growing cultural aversion to news (over a third of people sometimes or often actively avoid the news) has caused metrics across the industry to slow.</p>

            </div>
            <div class="two">
                <h5>PROBLEM</h5>
                <p>Our product page hadn’t changed in a major way in five years. Sentiment research suggested that users found the page boring and confusing while analytics reported stagnant product page to checkout conversion rates in 2022, at an average of 8.53%.</p>
                <br>
                <img class="eleven" zoomable src="images/product-page/product-page-old.png" alt="old mobile product page">

                </figure>
            </div>
            <div class="three">
                <h5>SOLUTION</h5>
                <p>I initiated a project to research, design, and test major changes to the product page in the hopes of increasing user engagement and thereby conversions.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="four">
                <h5>GOAL</h5>
                <p>As with all convert team initiatives, we aimed to increase our main KPI, conversion rate, and more specifically our secondary KPI, the product page to checkout conversion rate.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This project also fit under the umbrella of our internal goal to increase our subscriber numbers to 5 million by 2025. To add to our current paid cirulation of 2.7 million, we are re-evaluating conversion touchpoints like the product page.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="five">
                <h5>CONSTRAINTS</h5>
                <p>A large portion of our subscribers now come directly from our new checkout paywall instead of the product page. With less traffic to test variations to an already-converting touchpoint, the product team needs to see strong results to make a permanent change.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Admittedly, our billing model is complicated. On some promotions, we have three pricing steps at two different price points and two billing cycles. A large part of this complexity comes from our use of a 28-day billing cycle instead of a 1-month cycle. Our business stakeholders indicated that this was a non-negotiable as it provides significant profit.</p>

                <div class="three">
                    <h5>DISCOVERY</h5>
                    <p>To start, I held kickoff meetings with our product and marketing team to discuss the project, note internal hypotheses, and find potential avenues for investigation.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>With help from our research manager, Katie, I conducted 8 series of exploratory studies to create a baseline for how users perceive and interact with The Washington Post's and other competitors' subscription product pages. Of our 16 participants, 100% had existing digital subscriptions, 60% were BIPOC, 50% were marginalized genders, and 50% were non-coastal. The participants were split into moderated and unmoderated groups on either web, tablet, mobile iOS, or Android devices.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>I also reviewed more than 20 user sessions with LogRocket, a front-end recording tool, to better understand the user journey and pinpoint areas of friction. Lastly, I did a competitive audit of 30+ competitor subscription product pages, cataloging common design practices and sales tactics.</p>

                        <p><b>Internal Hypotheses</b></p>
                        <br>
                        <ul>
                            <li>My personal opinion was that our CTA copy was too long—often pushing 2 sentences. For example, the free trial offer CTA read "Try four weeks free then <s>$17</s> $6 every four weeks". I felt a short, targeted CTA would be clearer and convert better.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Chase, our International Marketing Manager, suggested we try a subscription 'fast-lane'. The hypothesis was that by allowing users to skip the decision matrix between two products and billing cycles and directly subscribe, we could remove friction and convert highly-motivated users.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Participants found The Washington Post product page “boring”, “simple”, “neat”, “straight-forward”, and “clean”. It was clear that we were communicating effectively, but not in an engaging way.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Participants specifically mentioned that there was a lack of insight into the product and company. Our product page was doing a lot of telling, but not enough showing.</li>

                            <li>Oddly enough, a test on the location of the subscription CTA found that placing it below the features on mobile and above the features on desktop was optimal.</li>

            <p>To prioritize and verify the efficacy of these hypotheses, I tested hypotheses 1 (visual overhaul), 2 (one-click CTA & why us section), and 3 (billing cycle & CTA copy) with 18 unmoderated users on mobile and web devices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Usability testing confirmed that hypotheses 1 (visual overhaul) and 2 (one-click CTA & why us section) resonated with users. They appreciated the sample content displayed in the new design and illustrations. Hypothesis 3 (billing cycle & CTA copy) had less conclusive results. However, I did find that users often missed the billing cycle toggle in other prototypes, suggesting the need for clearer monthly and yearly options.</p>

The financial impact of this winning design is projected at <b>$100K in-year revenue and $240K year-one impact</b>.

                    <h5>FUTURE</h5>
                    <p>Hypothesis 3 (billing cycle & CTA copy) is set for testing in June 2023. Depending on the outcome of this final test, we will decide which hypotheses will be permanently included on the product page. This may require additional design work and updates to other acquisition touchpoints (paywall, checkout, etc.) to match.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>In both discovery research and usability testing, users had trouble differentiating between our products. We are hopeful this finding will motivate brand marketing to rebrand our subscription offerings (names, features, prices, etc). Our design team could then work to attach specific visuals to each subscription offering, helping to make the decision easier for potential subscribers.</p>
